# rename-files-random

This script helps to add random prefixes at the beginning of the file.

I need this to mix the tracks on the memory card, because the radio in the car cannot do this.

***Usage:***

```
git clone https://github.com/minya92/rename-files-random.git
cd rename-files-random
python3 main.py ./files
```
